The CMCompare (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/software/cmcompare/) program takes
two Infernal covariance models and calculates the Link sequence and its Link
score. The Link sequence is the sequence scored by both models highest *at the
same time*. Two models with a high Link score are not well separated from each
other.
