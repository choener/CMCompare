Here are scripts to actually get some work done.



Required:

- a copy of CMCompare in "./"
  - this makes sure that rebuilding stuff does not affect us

- a symlink named "data"
  - here, input and output is dropped
  - stuff under data is not in darcs, but handled by Unison
  - the symlink should point somewhere in WorkData

- a symlink named "Rfam"
  - pointing to covariance models
  - the symlink will likely point to a symlink pointing to current CMs
